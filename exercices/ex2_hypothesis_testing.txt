4️⃣ Multiple testing problem
You run 20 independent statistical tests, each with a false positive rate (α) of 0.05.
	•	Compute the probability of getting at least one false positive among all tests.

5️⃣ Non-parametric data: number of siblings
In a class of 30 students, the number of siblings follows a Poisson distribution with mean 1.6.
	•	Simulate 30 values.
	•	Plot a histogram.
	•	Calculate the median and interquartile range (IQR).
	•	Why might a non-parametric test be more appropriate here?

6️⃣ Paired data: pre- and post-intervention
Reaction times (ms) are measured before and after an intervention in 20 participants.
	•	Simulate pre values from a normal distribution (mean 320, SD 40).
	•	Generate post values that are on average 25 ms faster (with some variability).
	•	Test if the difference is significant using a paired t-test.
